    [x] Interpreter for mapping reference via mapping_setting
    [x] handling of $default entries in mapping_setting instead of mapping
    [ ] make regex matching for mappings work
     #  probably to be realized in spcht_node_mapping()
    [x] $inherit parameter actually inherting the value in $default
    [ ] json error insights on load of file
    [ ] possible performance bottlenecks
    [ ] Filter Value for x
    [ ] Remove Parts of the value string
    [ ] Remove duplicated information # should not really matter but still
    [ ] MARC mutli Value for authors

    [ ] differenciate between graph and string that happens to be a link to somewhere
    [ ] generation of valid sparql queries
    [ ] shortening of queries with @prefix
    [ ] SPAQRL Escaping
* EXPORT
    [ ] export data directly to a .ttl file
* IMPORT
    [ ] you dont need to technically request *, just all the things you need, that might be less
